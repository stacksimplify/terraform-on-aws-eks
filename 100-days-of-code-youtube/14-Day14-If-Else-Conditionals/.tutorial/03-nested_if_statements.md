# Nested if statements
We can use if, if-else, elif statements inside other if statements as well. \
Example:
```python
num = 18
if (num < 0):
    print("Number is negative.")
elif (num > 0):
    if (num <= 10):
        print("Number is between 1-10")
    elif (num > 10 and num <= 20):
        print("Number is between 11-20")
    else:
        print("Number is greater than 20")
else:
    print("Number is zero")
```
Output:
```
Number is between 11-20
```
