# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?
## What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. 
If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. 
How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. 
This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!

## What is Python?

-   Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
-   Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
-   It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. 

## Features of Python

-   Python is simple and easy to understand.
-   It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
-   Python is an open-source programming language.
-   Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
-   It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

## What is Python used for

-   Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
-   Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
-   It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
-   It is used to create web applications.
-   It can be used to handle databases.
-   It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

## Why Replit?
- Replit is very easy to share tutorials and code.
- You can easily fork this repl and continue learning in your own style. Video, code as well as text tutorial on the same page which makes things easy!
- For fellow teachers out there, you create a .tutorial folder to create tutorials using replit.
