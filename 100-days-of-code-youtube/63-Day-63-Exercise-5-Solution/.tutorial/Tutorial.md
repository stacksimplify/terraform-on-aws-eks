## Snake Water Gun
Snake, Water and Gun is a variation of the children's game "rock-paper-scissors" where players use hand gestures to represent a snake, water, or a gun. The gun beats the snake, the water beats the gun, and the snake beats the water. Write a python program to create a Snake Water Gun game in Python using if-else statements. Do not create any fancy GUI. Use proper functions to check for win.
