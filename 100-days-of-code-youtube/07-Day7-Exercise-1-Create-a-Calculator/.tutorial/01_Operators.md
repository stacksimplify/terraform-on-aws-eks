# Operators
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.

|/|`Division`            |``` 5/3 ```            |
|%|`Modulus`            |``` 15%7 ```            |
|//|`Floor Division`            |``` 15//7 ```            |

# Exercise
```python
n = 15
m = 7
ans1 = n+m
print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)
ans2 = n-m
print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)
ans3 = n*m
print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)
ans4 = n/m
print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)
ans5 = n%m
print("Modulus of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)
ans6 = n//m
print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)
```
# Explaination
Here 'n' and 'm' are two variables in which the integer value is being stored. Variables 'ans1' , 'ans2' ,'ans3', 'ans4','ans5' and 'ans6' contains the outputs corresponding to addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, modulus and floor division respectively.
