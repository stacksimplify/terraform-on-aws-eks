# Day 5 - Comments, Escape sequence & Print in Python

Welcome to Day 5 of 100DaysOfCode. Today we will talk about Comments, Escape Sequences and little bit more about print statement in Python.
We will also throw some light on Escape Sequences

# Python Comments
A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing.

## Single-Line Comments:

To write a comment just add a ‘#’ at the start of the line.

### Example 1

```python
#This is a 'Single-Line Comment'
print("This is a print statement.")
``` 

Output:

```markup
This is a print statement. 
``` 

### Example 2

```python
print("Hello World !!!") #Printing Hello World
```

Output:

```markup
Hello World !!!
``` 

### Example 3:

```python
print("Python Program")
#print("Python Program")
``` 

### Output: 

```markup
Python Program
``` 
## Multi-Line Comments:

To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line or you can use the multiline string.

**Example 1:** The use of ‘#’.

```python
#It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
#If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code.
p = 7
if (p > 5):
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")
```


Output:

```markup
p is greater than 5.
```


**Example 2:** The use of multiline string.

```python
"""This is an if-else statement.
It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code."""
p = 7
if (p > 5):
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")
```


### Output

```markup
p is greater than 5.
```

# Escape Sequence Characters

To insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an escape sequence character.

An escape sequence character is a backslash  `\`  followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of a character that cannot be directly used in a string is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

```python
print("This doesnt "execute")
print("This will \" execute")
```

# More on Print statement
The syntax of a print statement looks something like this:

```python
print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)
```

## Other Parameters of Print Statement 
1. object(s): Any object, and as many as you like. Will be converted to string before printed
2. sep='separator': Specify how to separate the objects, if there is more than one. Default is ' '
3. end='end': Specify what to print at the end. Default is '\n' (line feed)
4. file: An object with a write method. Default is sys.stdout

Parameters 2 to 4 are optional
